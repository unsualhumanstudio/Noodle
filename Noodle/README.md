# Noodle

A Chrome extension that lets you highlight and save snippets from your Claude conversations (or any website) without breaking your flow.

## About me

I’m **Diana Valdes**, an AI experience product designer with an M.S. in Integrated Design, Business and Technology from the [University of Southern California Iovine & Young Academy](https://iovine-young.usc.edu/). I design, research and build interaction patterns for trustworthy human–AI collaboration. Noodle is one of those experiments—I hope others can take it further.

I write about the intersection of AI, design and the craft of building in my Substack **[The Dinner Party](https://dianafromthedinnerparty.substack.com/)**. I also share findings and a pattern library on my site **[dianavaldes.com](https://www.dianavaldes.com)**.

**If you’re a dev or designer:** follow along, spin up the project, share what you build, and reach out for collabs. I’d love to hear what you think—email me or say hi anytime.

## Features

### Saving & organizing

- **Highlight to save**: Select any text, pick a color from the toolbar, and save it instantly. A visual highlight confirms the save.
- **Three color categories**: Blue (Ideas), Green (Copy), and Coral (Questions) — each with a one-click save. Labels are customizable in Settings.
- **Folders**: Organize snippets into projects or subjects. Create folders from the sidebar (“+”) or when moving a snippet (“+ New Folder” in the folder picker).
- **Unfiled**: Snippets can stay unfiled; filter by “Unfiled” to see them.

### Finding & filtering

- **Filter by color**: Show All or only one category (Ideas, Copy, Questions).
- **Filter by folder**: Dropdown to show All Folders, Unfiled, or a specific folder.
- **Combined filters**: Use color and folder filters together to narrow the list.

### Snippet actions

- **Copy to clipboard**: One-click copy of the snippet text.
- **Move to folder**: Assign a snippet to a folder (or Unfiled) via the folder icon; create a new folder from the picker if needed.
- **Go to source**: Click the favicon/source link to open the original page. The extension scrolls to the snippet and briefly highlights it (flash highlight that fades). Works when opening in a new tab via a special URL hash.
- **Delete**: Remove a snippet from your list.

### Source page & “Go to source”

- **Text anchoring**: Snippets store the selected text plus surrounding context so the extension can find the same spot again on the page.
- **Scroll & flash highlight**: When you use “Go to source,” the page scrolls to the snippet and shows a short-lived highlight, even on dynamic content (with retries for pages like Slack, Teams, Gmail).

### Settings (gear icon in sidebar)

- **Enable on all websites**: Optional permission to run Noodle on any site, not just Claude. Toggle in Settings; Chrome will prompt for permission when you turn it on.
- **Color labels**: Rename the three categories (e.g. Ideas, Copy, Questions) to your own labels.
- **Folders**: View and delete folders. Deleting a folder moves its snippets to Unfiled.

### UI & behavior

- **Floating toggle**: Button in the corner opens the snippets sidebar. Badge shows total snippet count.
- **Draggable toggle**: Drag the toggle to reposition; position is saved and restored.
- **Tooltips**: Hover over color buttons, sidebar controls, and snippet actions for short descriptions.
- **Toasts**: Brief messages for actions like “Copied!”, “Saved to [label]”, “Moved to folder”, “Settings saved”.
- **Relative dates**: Snippets show “Just now”, “5m ago”, “2h ago”, “3d ago”, or a full date.
- **Favicon & URL**: Each snippet remembers the page URL and shows a favicon (with a fallback service when needed).

### Data & persistence

- **Persistent storage**: Snippets, folders, color labels, and toggle position are stored locally and survive browser restarts.
- **Local only**: Data stays in Chrome’s local storage on your machine.

Styling, color palette, typography, spacing, and component rules are documented in **[DESIGN_SYSTEM.md](./DESIGN_SYSTEM.md)**. Use it when adding or changing UI so the extension stays consistent (e.g. use the defined CSS variables for highlight colors, neutrals, shadows, and z-index layers).

3. Click the refresh icon on the Noodle card.
